TimeLapse
=========

Code and circuit diagram for time lapse control circuit using an MSP430 microcontroller connected to a cheap Chinese-made 808 "spy" camera.

Author: Martin Carney
Circuit design by: Martin Carney


Parts needed:
an 808 camera. Search on eBay for "keychain spy camera 808". Cheap models are about $7-15, nicer ones closer to $40
a micro-SD memory card, preferrably Class 4 or better.
an MSP430 launchpad. One of the microcontrollers will be used in the final circuit board
(optional, but really helps:) 10-pin DIP socket, which the microcontroller will be placed in.
2 diodes with a Foward Voltage Drop of 0.7v
a 3xAA battery holder (and batteries)
an 8-pin DIP switch
a tactile button
solder, soldering iron
PC Board for this project (see below)

The PC board can be etched, and to do you you will need:
a 1-sided copper-clad PCB
ferric chloride etchant
transparency printer sheets
access to a laser printer

Alternatively, you could use a solderable breadboard, but you're on your own for the layout.
